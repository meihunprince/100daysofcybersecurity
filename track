#Buffer Overflow - basics things to know

In simple words flooding the space with excess amount 
of data (larger than the allocated space) is called
Over flow .

Overflow occurs in stack part which follows LIFO.
ESP - Extended Stack Pointer 
EBP - Extended Base Pointer 
EIP - Extended Instruction Pointer 
EIP is main part coz it redirect or return the code to run
and when the overflow occurs it simply return the code 
which the attacker wants to run.

Buffer overflows are challenging to find,
when you detect one, it is generally hard to exploit.
